  title: HERE Custom Location Extension API Find the Five Nearest Locations
  description: |-
    *Request a list of user-defined locations within a circle around a fixed point*

    The search uses the `proximity` endpoint. The definition of the location and limit of the search is specified using  `coord` and `radius` parameters, and the number of results returned limited by adding the `limit` parameter to the request URL.



    * **layerId**  `text`
     \- Unique indicator used to retrieve a dataset

    * **coord**  `latlng`
     \- Center of the proximity search

    * **radius**  `number`
     \- width of the search corridor

    * **limit**  `number`
     \- The limit of the number of items contained in the response.

    * **app_id**  `text`
     \- A 20 byte Base64 URL-safe encoded string used for the authentication of the client application.    You must include an `app_id` with every request.

    * **app_code**  `text`
     \- A 20 byte Base64 URL-safe encoded string used for the authentication of the client application.    You must include an `app_code` with every request.
